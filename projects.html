                  Click the above image to view my current business analytics project. So far, the project contains the information about the data set I used. It also contains the methods I used to clean the data and how I went through the feature selection process. I currently have two types of models built. The first is a logistic regression model and the second is a KNN model. This project was all built using r studios.

                  Click the above image to view a word cloud. The purpose of the word cloud is to display what guest are thinking of after their stay at Mohonk Mountain House. The word cloud was made in r studios using the "wordcloud2" package. The data itself was mined from the guest surveys comment section that offered to each guest after their stay. The more frequently a word is used the larger it will appear. The empty space of the word cloud makes up the summer house that is Mohonk's logo.

                    I got married on September 3rd of 2022 and naturally it was one of the greatest days of my life. The wedding took place at the Spring Farm Trail Head of the Mohonk Preserve. The ceremony was located at their "Million Dollar View" and the reception to place at the "Slangerland Pavillion". Credit to Owl Eye studios for the photos.
