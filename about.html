            <h3>Mini Bio</h3>
            Hello, my name is Brian Bougton. My Birthday is August 26th, 1992. I was born in High Falls, New York. 
            I am a Business Analytics Major at SUNY New Paltz, and I am interested in learning about data mining and machine learning because I enjoy number crunching and statistics.
             I am currently learning analytics on RStudios and Python. 
             The current models I can build include linear regression, logistic regression, tree, random forest, k-nn, neural networks, and naive bayes. 
             Going forward, I would like to learn more about data cleaning and feature selection because they are so vital do the performance of the model.

            <h3>Meet The Family</h3>
            My family is the most important part of my life. 
            It is made up of my wife Sarah, our two dogs Lucky and Ranger, and our soon-to-be-son Bennett. 
            Sarah is training to become a mental health counselor at SUNY New Paltz. 
            Lucky is a 7-year-old Beagle that we rescued after his previous owner died. He weighed over 50 pounds and was very out of shape. 
            Now, he is a healthy 35 pounds and can enjoy running around. 
            Ranger is a 4-year-old shih tzu bichon and acts like a little human that is obsessed with watching television and going on long walks. 
            Together we enjoy hikes on either the “River to Ridge” trail or the “Mohonk Preserve”.
