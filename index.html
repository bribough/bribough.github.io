        Hello, my name is Brian Bougton. My Birthday is Augest 26th 1992 and I was born in High Falls New York. I am a Business Analytics Major
        at SUNY New Paltz. I am interested in learning about data mining and machine learning because I enjoy number crunching and statistics. 
        My current occupation is being a Guest Service Team Member at Mohonk Mountain House.
        In my spare time you can see me enjoying some hiking with my wife and our two dogs.
